## The ever changing world 

 On January 9, 2007, a storm swept through San Francisco, California, when Steve Jobs introduced the first [iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qPAY9JqE4). This marked the beginning of a new era, the era of smartphones. This storm not only swept away mobile giants of that time like Nokia and BlackBerry but also brought about a series of technological changes and user experience approaches, not only in the mobile device realm but also in areas such as the replacement of the prevailing Multi-Page Applications with Single-Page Applications.

During this period, just less than a year prior, Amazon launched a series of Cloud Computing services such as EC2 and S3, ushering in the era of the cloud. Subsequently, major players like Microsoft and Google scrambled to release their own Cloud Computing services in 2008. IBM, on the other hand, acquired [SoftLayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Cloud) in 2013 and introduced IBM Bluemix in 2014, six years after the initial developments.

In 2013, Docker was born, bringing a significant advancement in software deployment methods. We no longer package software components directly into servers to update packages. Instead, we package the entire User Space and Application into a Docker Image, making deployment easy and minimizing risks in software releases. As you can see, this is once again changing with Serverless Architecture, which focuses on deploying individual features instead of a single large image.

Looking back on a longer journey, we can see that the technology industry is constantly evolving. From Java and .NET monolithic applications with Domain-Driven Architecture in the 1990s, to the development of Non-Blocking and Event-Driven Architecture in the 2000s, and now the world of Microservices, Data Analytics, and AI. The world of technology is like a big storm, constantly spinning and moving, demanding that technology professionals adapt and continuously learn.

We can observe this dynamic nature not only in project management methodologies, transitioning from Waterfall to Agile and Scrum, but also in the business and political realms. The world is constantly changing. To adapt to this world, we must keep moving and renewing ourselves.

## Continuous learning

What do you do in the morning before diving into an exhausting 8-hour workday? Have breakfast, exercise, make a glass of iced tea, and browse Facebook? We always have these moments to start a new day. Work and life may overwhelm us, but there is a paradox: working hard does not necessarily mean we are adapting to changes, no matter how much experience we have.

In the years 2012-2014, I participated in developing a Verifone point-of-sale (POS) machine for 3 years using the C language. This project was very successful, and even until now, from 2015-2018, I can see the wide usage of the product in supermarkets and retailers through banks like Vietinbank and Vietcombank. However, a challenge arose from this success. After those 3 years, I felt the need for a career change and started attending job interviews. I realized that I was no longer meeting the market's demands and needed to change and update my skills. I took a step back and sought new development opportunities with more modern programming languages like Python and NodeJS. Looking back, I still consider that decision the most important one in my career journey. It helped me completely change my mindset, adapt to any circumstances, stay updated with technology, and seize opportunities.

So how do you update your technology skills?

Nowadays, we have access to updates through the internet and daily tech news websites. For me personally, I receive at least one email or phone notification from Medium every day about new articles. Before starting my workday, I make it a habit to read one of those articles. Reading blogs is a simple way to stay updated, and it doesn't consume too much time. It provides fresh perspectives, even on topics we are already familiar with. Alternatively, we can simply search on Google and find relevant blog articles on the topics we want to learn about.

As technology professionals, we cannot overlook the importance of using English with skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Developers often struggle with improving their listening and speaking skills. For me, listening to [talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcxN0fmKayxy_7V8Rnb-zsZzLvpcp0G8T), regardless of the field, has been a method to practice my English listening skills. Just 10-15 minutes a day is beneficial as we not only learn English but also acquire new knowledge.

When we graduate or have been working for several years, we will work in companies, and Nashtech is an excellent place for learning with its professional environment and renowned training programs. We learn a lot from participating in projects. If you are a software engineer, there is nothing better than being involved in projects, experiencing new technologies, and learning knowledge and work methods from those projects. Additionally, Nashtech provides diverse training courses in various technology fields, making it easier for us to access new technologies or modern technology trends.

In such an environment, we are not alone. We have a community to share experiences and knowledge. During projects, tea breaks, or coffee brewing at the pantry, we always encounter random knowledge exchanges. Sometimes, we are compelled to read about certain topics, whether we already know them or not.

Have you ever thought about leveling up? Or achieving a higher salary? How to become a leader? Blogs or technology discussions are fantastic. They provide unlimited pieces of knowledge. However, sometimes we need deeper understanding to connect what we already know, to synthesize incomplete knowledge, and build a systematic knowledge foundation. We can find this through two approaches: reading books and getting certified.

It's ironic how we often say that certifications don't mean we can actually apply that knowledge in projects, or that certifications are only for embellishing our CVs. No, the sweetness does not lie in the destination; it lies in the journey. The process of learning and preparing for certifications is entirely different from working on projects. It helps us clarify blurry points in our knowledge and systematize fragmented knowledge.

As for reading books, I know it's not an easy task. We are Vietnamese, and books are written in English with complex knowledge. But books provide a comprehensive theoretical perspective. We need to connect theory with practice to create our own knowledge. Books give us the foundation to adapt, so that new technologies and theories are no longer obstacles. They make Monolithic and Microservices no longer conflicting areas, and they help us envision the future.

## Work-life balance 

We shouldn't let work overwhelm us. We are a community, and continuous learning serves not only our work but also our lives. Continuous learning is a mindset that helps us embrace new things, from knowledge to lifestyle approaches. Recently, Nashtech has initiated fitness and sports activities. Colleagues in the office encourage each other to go for a run to improve our health, share experiences, and build a community on the Strava app.

Continuous learning not only helps us harmonize our lives and find new goals in different life stages, but it also provides us with more energy for our families and careers. It helps us organize our lives more effectively.

But let's keep looking forward, keep the hunger, keep the foolishness, keep doing whatever you want to do. And one day, when you look back, you'll see that you have had an amazing experience.

Stay hungry, stay foolish.
